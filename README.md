Library Management System overviews the concept of storing and generating all the data and records of the books contained within the library.
Our team created a system which helps make life easier for every individual that uses the library.
With a few clicks borrowers can find their desired book or a librarian can scan the information and easily guide them to their book. 
Librarians can track the flow of books, find the due dates, see how and when a book was borrowed, along with other helpful pieces of information.
The system will connect with all the available branches thus will increase everyone’s parameter beyond a single library.
It’s fast, accurate and cost effective. The system will work efficiently to the maximum level while reducing human hours. <br/>
